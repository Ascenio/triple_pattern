# Mixin


## Memento with MementoMixin

You can add, undo or redo a state using the Memento Pattern. 
This means that you can return to the previous state using the method **undo()** and also advance with the method **redo()**.

```dart

class Counter extends StreamStore<Exception, int> with MementoMixin {}

```
