# What is Triple?

Triple is a nickname to SSP.

## Extension (Dart)

As we have seen, the purpose of the Segmented State Standard (Triple) is to help normalize state management logic. We are working on abstractions (packages) based on reactivities developed by the community and Flutter natives such as ValueNotifier and Streams. More details in the documentation of the abstractions themselves.

- [triple](https://pub.dev/packages/triple) (Abstraction to Dart)
- [flutter_triple](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_triple) (Implements **triple** building Stores based on Stream and ValueNotifier)
- [mobx_triple](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx_triple) (MobXStore)
